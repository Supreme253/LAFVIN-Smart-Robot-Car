# LAFVIN-Smart-Robot-Car
This project aims to develop a car that can follow a line of tape using IR line tracking sensors. The KIT was purchased from Amazon and the body was used for the project. My team and I designed the PCB using EAGLE software. I was mainly in charge of troubleshooting the vehicle. I soldered the components together(capacitor, resistor, inductors, etc.) to implement the ICU chip into the PCB. The chip contained the files necessary to run the vehicle as intended. The software that we used is from the Arduino software where we programmed in Python. I was in charge of uploading the code into the chip using Linux. I deleted, copied, and added files throughout the process of the project. I was also in charge of wiring motors and pins to assigned locations for the movement of the vehicle, testing motors, testing the flow of voltage, and assembling and descrambling the vehicle needed to place PCB onto the Arduino sensor shield. My team members were in charge of software applications and the design of the PCB.

Arduino.png shows schematics of the Arduino UNO R3 where me and my team had to design V3 as a schematic for our PCB. V4 shows the complete design of our PCB. We used EAGLE software for the design of the PCB. 
There is an attachment of the Gerber files (not necessary to your eyes) needed for our PCB.
