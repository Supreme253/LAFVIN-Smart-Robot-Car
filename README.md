# LAFVIN-Smart-Robot-Car
This project aims to develop a car that can follow a line of tape using IR line tracking sensors. The car will be equipped with machine learning algorithms that will teach it to recognize specific types of tape to be followed. The learning process will be facilitated by a reward system that provides positive reinforcement for successful recognition of the tape. The car will have a three-wheel configuration, with two wheels at the back for forward movement and one wheel at the front for turning. The proposed system has the potential to provide a practical solution for autonomous navigation in constrained environments.


Arduino.png show schematics of the arduino UNO R3 where me and my team had to design V3 as a schmatic for our PCB. V4 shows the complete design of our PCB. We used EAGLE software for the design of the PCB. 
There is an attahcment of the gerber files (not neccssary to your eyes) needed for our PCB.
